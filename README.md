This project involves building an intelligent chatbot system powered by deep learning techniques. The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries and generating relevant, human-like responses in natural language.

The core architecture is based on a neural network model‚Äîtypically a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model or a Transformer-based model like BERT or GPT. These models are trained on conversational datasets to learn context, semantics, and appropriate response generation.
üîç Key Features:

    Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot can understand user intent and extract relevant information from input sentences.

    Contextual Conversations: Deep learning enables the chatbot to maintain context across multiple turns of conversation.

    Response Generation: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture to generate meaningful and contextually accurate replies.

    Pretrained Models: May utilize pretrained NLP models such as GPT, BERT, or T5 for better performance and faster development.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

    Python

    TensorFlow / PyTorch

    NLTK / spaCy for preprocessing

    Transformers (Hugging Face library)

    Flask / Streamlit (for web-based interface)
