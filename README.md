This project involves building an intelligent chatbot system powered by deep learning techniques. The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries and generating relevant, human-like responses in natural language.

The core architecture is based on a neural network modelâ€”typically a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model or a Transformer-based model like BERT or GPT. These models are trained on conversational datasets to learn context, semantics, and appropriate response generation.
